Issues:

I decided to add Firebase last minute to use a noSQL database, unforutunately this added Crashlytics and
after trying every single solution on Google to fix the build error, I am unable to build it in Android, however, it works perfectly on web
using both 'ionic serve' and 'ionic serve -l'
